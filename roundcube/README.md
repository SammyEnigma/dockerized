Daily rebuild of roundcube-git based on [eilandert/apache-phpfpm:8.0](https://hub.docker.com/r/eilandert/apache-phpfpm)
(ubuntu:rolling with [Apache2](https://launchpad.net/~eilander/+archive/ubuntu/apache2) and [PHP](https://launchpad.net/~ondrej/+archive/ubuntu/php))

See [docker-compose](https://github.com/eilandert/dockerized/blob/master/roundcube/docker-compose.yml) for examples

I'll try to maintain compatability with the official (roundcube)[https://hub.docker.com/r/roundcube/roundcubemail] image. Let me know it something doesn't work!
